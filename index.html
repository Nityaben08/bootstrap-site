		<h3>Why  our  company  uses  Renewable  enery</h3>
		<p>One major advantage with the use of renewable energy is that as it is renewable it is therefore sustainable and so will never run out.</p>

		<p>Renewable energy facilities generally require less maintenance than traditional generators. Their fuel being derived from natural and available resources reduces the costs of operation.</p>

		<p>Even more importantly, renewable energy produces little or no waste products such as carbon dioxide or other chemical pollutants, so has minimal impact on the environment.</p>

		<p>Renewable energy projects can also bring economic benefits to many regional areas, as most projects are located away from large urban centres and suburbs of the capital cities. These economic benefits may be from the increased use of local services as well as tourism.

		<h3>Why  there  is  a  need  of  using  Renewable  energy?</h3>
		<p>There is a current global need for clean and renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels are non-renewable and require finite resources, which are dwindling because of high cost and environmentally damaging retrieval techniques. So, the need for cheap and obtainable resources is greatly needed. An efficient and more feasible alternative option is solar energy.</p>

		<p>Solar energy is a more practical type of energy due to its plentiful availability; it is derived directly from the sun. In 2010, renewable energy only provided 8 percent of the total energy consumption in the United States.</p>

		<p>Many people probably wonder: if renewable energy is so beneficial, why donâ€™t we consume more of it? The answer to the question is that many of the renewable energy sources are more expensive and more difficult to retrieve. Thus, because of these limitations, the consumption of fossil fuels has grown to an exorbitant rate.</p>
